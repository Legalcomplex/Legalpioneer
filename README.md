# Legal Tech Company Profiles by Legalcomplex

This dataset is part of the larger `legalcomplex` dataset, which provides detailed profiles of companies operating in and around the legal process industry. The data was originally posted on Legalpioneer.org and has been made available under the Open Database License (ODbl).

## Description

The dataset contains a variety of information about 13,000+ companies, including but not limited to:

- Company name
- Industry sector
- Scope of operations
- Size in terms of personnel
- Financial data where available

This dataset is intended for students, researchers, entrepreneurs, legal professionals, and industry analysts who are interested in the legal process industry's landscape.

## Data Dictionary

For a understanding of each field within the CSV file, please refer to the `data_dictionary.md` file included in this repository. The data dictionary outlines every column in the dataset, its data type, and a description of what each entry represents. Note that 'Legal Tech' is in the eye of the beholder. Check the [FAQ](https://legalpioneer.org/faq) on Legalpioneer.org for some background.

To use this dataset, you should:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary software to open and manipulate CSV files (e.g., Excel, R, Python with pandas).

## Tips
- **Market Size Calculation**: Allocate a single category to each profile to prevent overlap in data categorization.
  
- **Growth Measurement**: Combine employee counts with company age and financial data. For example, a young company with a growing employee count and $0 in funding represents genuine growth.

- **Market Size Definition**: Market size should be assessed by the total number of companies and their investment amounts.
