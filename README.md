# Legal Tech Company Profiles by Legalcomplex

This dataset is part of the larger `legalcomplex` dataset, which provides detailed profiles of companies operating in and around the legal process industry. The data was originally posted on Legalpioneer.org and has been made available under the Open Database License (ODbl).

## Description

The dataset contains a variety of information about 13,000+ companies, including but not limited to:

- Company name
- Industry sector
- Scope of operations
- Size in terms of personnel
- Financial data where available

This dataset is intended for students, researchers, entrepreneurs, legal professionals, and industry analysts who are interested in the legal process industry's landscape.

## Data Dictionary

For a understanding of each field within the CSV file, please refer to the `data_dictionary.md` file included in this repository. The data dictionary outlines every column in the dataset, its data type, and a description of what each entry represents. Note that 'Legal Tech' is in the eye of the beholder. Check the [FAQ](https://legalpioneer.org/faq) on Legalpioneer.org for some background. 

## Usage

To use this dataset, you should:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary software to open and manipulate CSV files (e.g., Excel, R, Python with pandas).
2. Review the data dictionary to understand the dataset's structure.
3. Import the dataset into your preferred data analysis tool or AI framework.
4. Perform your analysis or extract insights as required.
5. Share your findings with the world.

## Tips
- **Market Size Calculation**: Allocate a single category to each profile to prevent overlap in data categorization.
- **Market Size Definition**: Market size should be assessed by the total number of companies and their investment amounts.
- **Growth Measurement**: Combine employee counts with company age and financial data. For example, a young company with a growing employee count and $0 in funding represents genuine growth.
- **Health Indicators**: Market size and growth can indicate which market areas are thriving.
- **Context is Everything**: Compare recent announcements with past metrics to avoid recency bias. Recency bias can create artificial trends in data interpretation.

3. What type of companies were excluded? Dead or acquired companies at discovery. SmartTech companies that leverage large language models to solve business and civic problems e.g. OpenAI. FinTech, RiskTech and WealthTech, see spark_max_investors.

## Btw, are you looking for investors for your (legal) venture?

We dropped 35,000+ on our GitHub - [https://lnkd.in/eqzyUkij](https://lnkd.in/eqzyUkij)

### What is it?

The `spark_max_investors.csv` file was collected while tracking investments in legal. Every time we stored an investment, we also collected who invested.

### Why is this special?

The file also has metrics per investor to see if they have or have not invested in legal and...will be interested in investing early 😇.

So you can now search for investors based on the fear of missing out (FOMO) on legal 😈.

Btw, If you want to avoid investors in your competitors, let's chat.

### 4 Datageeks

Legalpioneer has a new column 'number of rounds'. This helps you calculate who and where growth is real versus artificial e.g. multiple rounds with flat employee growth equals artificial 🍭.

### Why are we sharing all this data?

AI should help find and fund 💰 better legal startups. Earth has too many conflicts to resolve ☮️.
